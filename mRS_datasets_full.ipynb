    "\n",
    "When we predict the outcome of a person who has had a stroke, we want to be able to say what is the likely improvement in disability level they would experience due to the treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disability levels may be measured in various ways. In this project we are using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). It is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scale runs from 0-6, running from perfect health without symptoms to death:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Score | Description |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| 0 | No symptoms. |\n",
    "| 1 | No significant disability. Able to carry out all usual activities, despite some symptoms. |\n",
    "| 2 | Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities. |\n",
    "| 3 | Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted. |\n",
    "| 4 | Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted. |\n",
    "| 5 | Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent. |\n",
    "| 6 | Dead. |\n",
    "\n",
    "The improvement in disability level they can get will depend on the time from when their stroke symptoms began and when they receive treatment. The best possible outcome would be if they were treated immediately after they had their stroke. The benefit of treatment reduces over time until the treatment no longer offers any benefit, and they will not be better off than having no treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we describe how we estimate the spread of disability levels if treatment was given immediately after the stroke (at *t = 0*), and what the spread of disability levels would be if the treatment was given at a time when it was no longer effective (at *t = No Effect*). These are two key pieces of information we will later use to estimate the spread of disability levels if we know the time after stroke symptoms began when a person was treated with either thrombolysis (IVT), a clot-busting medication, or thrombectomy (MT), the physical removal of a clot. The methodology described here is for patients with an ischaemic stroke (a stroke that is caused by a clot), where the location of the clot is either in a large vessel occlusion (LVO), or not (nLVO)."

    "# Method\n",
    "\n",
    "A more in depth description of the method is found in the document [predicting granular disability outcomes after treatment of stroke with thrombolysis (IVT) or thrombectomy (MT)](./intro.md) \n",
    "\n",
    "This model contains mRS outcome distributions for three patient-treatment cohorts: 1) nLVO-IVT (patients with an nLVO that are treated with IVT), 2) LVO-IVT (patients with an LVO that are treated with IVT), 3) LVO-MT (patients with an LVO that are treated with MT). For each patient-treatment cohort, we estimate two mRS distributions: one mRS distribution if treatment is given at *t = 0* (time of stroke onset), and one mRS distribution if treatment is given at *t = No Effect* (time of no effect). In order to estimate these two mRS distributions, we use data from reperfusion treatment clinical trials and stroke admission data from England and Wales (Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme, SSNAP). To select the relevant patients for each cohort we will use the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) on arrival as a surrogate to classify patients as nLVO (NIHSS 0-10) or LVO (NIHSS 11+).\n",
    "\n",
    "All mRS distributions created are based on the assumption that, following treatment, the mRS distribution will lie between two extremes: 1) reperfusion perfectly restores function, and the resulting mRS distribution is the same as the pre-stroke mRS distribution (this data is obtained from the SSNAP dataset), and 2) reperfusion treatment fails to restore any function and the resulting mRS distribution is the same as a control untreated population, though with added excess deaths that may be caused by the treatment. To create required mRS distributions we find a weighting between these two extremes that give us a distribution that matches published reference points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *t = 0* mRS distributions are calculated to give the expected mRS distributions if treatment was given immediately after stroke onset, and also include the risk of excess deaths caused by taking the treatment. Further details specific to stroke type and treatment type are given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *t = No Effect* mRS distributions are based on mRS distribution data when patients did not receive any treatment (this represents what will happen if the patient takes the treatment at *t = No Effect*). This data is obtained from the untreated control group in clinical trials and further adjusted to include the risk of excess deaths caused by taking the treatment. Further details specific to stroke type and treatment type are given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this description it can be seen that for each patient-treatment cohort four pieces of information are required:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **pre-stroke mRS distribution** (fully recovered) \n",
    "2) **treatment has no effect mRS distribution**\n",
    "3) **excess deaths** due to treatment \n",
    "4) **weights** to combine the two mRS distributions (pre-stroke and no effect) to represent the *t = 0* mRS distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we describe how we obtain these four pieces of information for the three patient-treatment cohorts.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Pre-stroke mRS distribution** (fully recovered)\n",
    "\n",
    "The *pre-stroke mRS distribution* is taken from the SSNAP dataset, extracting the patients that have an ischaemic stroke and using NIHSS 0-10 as a surrogate for nLVO, or NIHSS 11+ as a surrogate for LVO to further extract the relevant patients for each patient-treatment cohort. This mRS distribution is then corrected for the excess deaths due to treatment (see *weights* subsection below for more information).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Treatment has no effect mRS distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "* For *nLVO patients* the *no effect mRS distribution* is taken from the untreated control group of combined nLVO/LVO data from Lees et al. 2010, and from that we remove the contribution of the LVO patients by using the results from the untreated control group of LVO-only data from Goyal et al. 2016. Each mRS distribution (Lees, and Goyal) are adjusted to account for the excess deaths due to IVT treatment (using their relevant patient type: nLVO and/or LVO, see *weights* subsection below for more information). The two mRS distributions are then combined, using weightings (154% Lees and -54% Goyal) chosen such that the resulting mRS distribution represents just the nLVO patients and matches the P(mRS <= 1, *t = No Effect\"*) of 0.46 (from the control group in Emberson with NIHSS of 0-10).\n",
    "\n",
    "* For *LVO patients* the *no effect mRS distribution* is taken from the untreated control population from Goyal et al. 2016.  This mRS distribution is then corrected for the excess deaths due to treatment (see *weights* subsection below for more information).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Excess deaths**\n",
    "\n",
    "All mRS distributions are corrected for the *excess deaths* due to treatment. We use 1.10% for nLVO patients with IVT, 3.41% for LVO patients with IVT, 2.29% for a combination of nLVO/LVO patients with IVT (Emberson et al., 2014), and 3.6% for MT (Goyal et al., 2016). See appendix for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **Weights** (for combining the no effect and fully recovered mRS distributions for t = 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "* For nLVO patients treated with IVT at *t = 0* the *weights* used to combine the two mRS distributions (61% fully recovered & 39% no effect) were informed by data from Emberson et al. 2014, and found in order to match the P(mRS <= 1, t=0) of 0.63. 46% of patients with NIHSS 0-10 had mRS 0-1 in the untreated group (see figure 2 Emberson et al. 2014). Translated into a odds of a good outcome (0.85), and multipied with the odds ratio for mRS 0-1 at *t = 0* (which is 2.0, obtained from extrapolating back to *t = 0* in figure 1 Emberson et al. 2014), gives a probability of 63%.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For LVO patients treated with IVT at *t = 0* the *weights* used to combine these two mRS distributions (18% fully recovered & 82% no effect) are chosen to match predicted P(mRS <= 1, t=0) of 0.20, which is set as a target by extrapolating the control group mRS for patients with NIHSS 11+ from Emberson et al. 2014 back to a predicted odds ratio of mRS 0-1 of 2.0 at *t = 0*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For LVO patients treated with MT at *t = 0* the *weights* used to combine these two mRS distributions (75% fully recovered & 25% no effect) are taken from Hui et al. 2020, who reported 75% successful recanalisation with thrombectomy. We assume that recanalisation at t=0 restores all pre-stroke function*. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\*Extrapolating results of good outcome, when recanalisation has been achieved with MT, from Fransen et al. 2016 back to *t = 0*, assuming 75% recanalisation, gives the same proportion of patients with mRS <= 2 as the pre-stroke mRS in the SSNAP data (therefore this extrapolation would suggest full recovery of all health with MT theoretically carried out at *t = 0*).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Also calculated in this notebook, and stored for future use, are the **no treatment mRS distributions** that are used as the control populations: 1) nLVO without treatment; 2) LVO without treatment.\n",

    "#### IVT deaths due to fatal intracranial haemorrhage (Emberson et al., 2014): \n",

    "| NIHSS | Treated | Control | Excess |\n",
    "|-------|---------|---------|--------|\n",
    "| 0-10  | 1.41%   | 0.32%   | 1.10%  |\n",
    "| 11+   | 3.85%   | 0.45%   | 3.41%  |\n",
    "| All   | 2.68%   | 0.39%   | 2.29%  |\n",
    "\n",
    "Excess deaths due to IVT are assumed to occur independently of time. Differing risks of death are applied according to whether the patient is assumed nLVO (NIHSS 0-10 as a surrogate for nLVO) or LVO (NIHSS 11+, as a surrogate for LVO). Note: Rounding errors exist in the \"Excess\" column.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use Embersons 2.29% excess deaths from IVT on all patients (nLVO and LVO) with the combined nLVO/LVO population from Lees et al. 2010. From the available trial data, we assume that the split between nLVO/LVO is as near the same in both Lees and Emberson:\n",
    "* Lees has 3670 patients, they provide a granular level of mRS distribution for their population (combined nLVO/LVO) but they do not provide the proportions of the split.\n",
    "* Emberson has 6756 patients (they have the 3035 patients from IST-3 in addition to those in Lees, with 51 unaccounted for), they provide the excess deaths by stroke severity. To obtain their value of 2.29% excess deaths from IVT for all patients, this requires a weighting of 48.27% nLVO and 51.73% LVO.\n",
    "* IST-3 has 3035 patients and provide proportion of patients by stroke severity: 48.24% nLVO and 51.76% LVO. This is as near as the same that we have calculated in Emberson. \n",
    "* Assuming that Lees contains the other patients in Emberson (those not from IST-3), then it is a fair assumption that Lees has the same split (nLVO/LVO) of patients as Emberson, and so can use 2.29% excess deaths from IVT for Lees combined nLVO/LVO population.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MT deaths (Goyal et al., 2016):\n",
    "\n",
    "| Treated | Control | Excess |\n",
    "|---------|---------|--------|\n",
    "| 18.9%   | 15.3%   | 3.6%   |\n",
    "\n",
    "The control group in Goyal et al. do not receive MT, but do receive other interventions such as IVT (used in 83% of patients). No additional IVT-related deaths need to be considered when modelling use of MT as the control group (used to estimate the effect of MT at a time MT is no longer effective) already includes IVT-related excess deaths."
