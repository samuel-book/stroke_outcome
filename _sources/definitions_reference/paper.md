# Paper creation

This document contains the main results in the paper and links to more details on each in this online book.

All data was created on DATE THE DATETH OF DATE using the following package versions:

+ stroke-outcome==0.1.6 OR WSOMETHEING
+ stroke-maps==0.1.6 OR WSOMETHEING
+ ...

The full list of packages used is provided in a conda environment, 


## mRS distribution derivation

More info: [Derivation of mRS distributions from reference data](https://samuel-book.github.io/stroke_outcome/outcome_model_methods/01_mrs_dist_derivation.html)

Table 1 contains the derived mRS distributions:

The data behind the table can be accessed by:
+ reading the file directly on GitHub. It is stored in the directory /ss/s/s/s/ with filename s.s.ds.d.d.csv.
+ installing the stroke-outcome package and importing the data as above.


## Probability with time
