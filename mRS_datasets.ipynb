    "\n",
    "Disability levels may be measured in various ways. In this project we are using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). It is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scale runs from 0-6, running from perfect health without symptoms to death:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Score | Description |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| 0 | No symptoms. |\n",
    "| 1 | No significant disability. Able to carry out all usual activities, despite some symptoms. |\n",
    "| 2 | Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities. |\n",
    "| 3 | Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted. |\n",
    "| 4 | Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted. |\n",
    "| 5 | Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent. |\n",
    "| 6 | Dead. |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When we predict the outcome of a person who has had a stroke, we want to be able to say what is the likely improvement in disability level they would experience due to the treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The improvement they can get will depend on the time from when their stroke symptoms began and when they receive treatment. The best possible outcome would be if they were treated immediately after they had their stroke. The benefit of treatment reduces over time until the treatment no longer offer any benefit, and they will not be better off than having no treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we describe how we estimate the spread of disability levels if treatment was given immediately after the stroke, and what the spread of disability levels would be if the treatment was given at a time when it was no longer effective. These are two key pieces of information we will later use to estimate the spread of disability levels if we know the time after stroke symptoms began when a person was treated with either thrombolysis (clot-busting medication) or thrombectomy (physical removal of a clot).
