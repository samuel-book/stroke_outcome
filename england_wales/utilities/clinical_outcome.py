class Clinical_outcome:
    """
    Predicts modified Rankin Scale (mRS) distributions for ischaemic stroke
    patients depending on time to treatment with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT)
    or mechanical thrombectomy (MT). Results are broken down for large vessel
    occulusions (LVO) and non large vessel occlusions (nLVO).

    Inputs
    ------

    A Pandas DataFrame object of mRS distributions for:
    1) Untreated nLVO
    2) nLVO treated at t=0 (time of stroke onset) with IVT
    3) nLVO treated at time of no-effect (includes treatment deaths)
    4) Untreated LVO
    5) LVO treated at t=0 (time of stroke onset) with IVT
    6) LVO treated with IVT at time of no-effect (includes treatment deaths)
    7) LVO treated at t=0 (time of stroke onset) with IVT
    8) LVO treated with IVT at time of no-effect (includes treatment deaths)

    Time of IVT and MT.

    Outputs
    -------

    mRS distributions (bins & cumulative), changes in dists, and mean mRS, for:
    1) LVO untreated
    2) nLVO untreated
    3) LVO treated with IVT
    4) LVO treated with MT
    5) nLVO treated with IVT

    mRS mean shift (compared with untreated) and proportion of patients with
    improved mRS for:
    1) LVO treated with IVT
    2) LVO treated with MT
    3) nLVO treated with IVT

    Utility-weighted mRS
    --------------------

    In addition to mRS we may calculate utility-weighted mRS. Utility is an
    estimated quality of life (0=dead, 1=full quality of life, neagtive numbers
    indicate a 'worse than death' outcome).

    mRS Utility scores are based on a pooled Analysis of 20 000+ Patients. From
    Wang X, Moullaali TJ, Li Q, Berge E, Robinson TG, Lindley R, et al. 
    Utility-Weighted Modified Rankin Scale Scores for the Assessment of Stroke
    Outcome. Stroke. 2020 Aug 1;51(8):2411-7. 

    | mRS Score | 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5     | 6    |
    |-----------|------|------|------|------|------|-------|------|
    | Utility   | 0.97 | 0.88 | 0.74 | 0.55 | 0.20 | -0.19 | 0.00 |

    General methodology
    -------------------

    The model assumes that log odds of mRS <= x declines uniformally with time.
    The imported distribution give mRS <= x probabilities at t=0 (time of
    stroke onset) and time of no effect. These two distributions are converted
    to log odds and weighted according to the fraction of time, in relation to
    when the treatment no longer has an effect, that has passed. The weighted
    log odds distribution is converted back to probability of mRS <= x. mRS
    are also converted to a utility-weighted mRS.

    The time to no-effect is taken as:
    1) 6.3 hours for IVT
      (from Emberson et al, https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60584-5.)
    2) 8 hours for MT
      (from Fransen et al; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2015.3886.
      this analysis did not include late-presenting patients selected by
      advanced imaging).

    1,000 (default #) patients are then sampled from the untreated and treated
    distributions (samples may be taken randomly or evenly spaced).
    This gives sampled mRS distributions. The shift in mRS for each patient
    between untreated and treated distribution is also calculated. A negative
    shift is indicative of improvement (lower MRS disability score).
