<p>Reword “The mRS distribution for patients for which the treatment had no effect at t=0 is is assumed to be the same as patients that were not treated, but then adjusted to include the risk of excess deaths caused by taking the treatment. We obtained this mRS distribution by taking the weighted combination of the untreated control group of combined nLVO/LVO (weight = 149%) data from Lees et al. 2010  and the untreated control group of LVO-only data from Goyal et al. 2016 (weight = -49%).These weights effectively represent a subtraction of LVO numbers from combined nLVO/LVO numbers. Weightings are calculated to match the P(mRS &lt;= 1) of 46% (from the control group in Emberson with NIHSS of 0-10). This distribution is then corrected for the excess deaths due to treatment with IVT.” <strong>KP: I’ve had a go at this. But need to change the weightings to the real ones used.</strong></p>

<h1>Predicting granular disability outcomes after treatment of stroke with thrombolysis (IVT) or thrombectomy (MT)<a class="headerlink" href="#predicting-granular-disability-outcomes-after-treatment-of-stroke-with-thrombolysis-ivt-or-thrombectomy-mt" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h1>
<p>This notebook describes the basic methodology for estimating disability outcomes for stroke patients, depending on time to treatment with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) or mechanical thrombectomy (MT).</p>
<p>The methodology described here is for patients with an ischaemic stroke (a stroke that is caused by a clot). These patients can be further defined by the location of the clot: those with a large vessel occlusion (LVO); and those not with a large vessel occlusion (nLVO). Patients with an nLVO can be treated with thrombolysis (IVT), a clot-busting medication. Patients with an LVO can be treated with IVT and/or thrombectomy (MT), which physically removes the clot. The benefit received by the patient from either treatment (IVT and/or MT) are time dependent, such that the sooner they are administered, the better the outcome, with each treatment having no effect after a specified duration (6.3 hours for IVT, and 8 hours for MT). In other words, the sooner a patient recieves reperfusion treatment the fewer stroke related disabilities they could end up with.</p>
<p>Until now, modelling the outcome from stroke reperfusion treatment was a dichotomous affair, with a patient classified as either being disability free, or with stroke related disabilities. This method described here aims to provide a more granular disability outcome, describing the resulting disability as one of six levels (ranging from disability free, to death).</p>
<p>This method calculates disability outcome estimates for three patient-treatment cohorts: 1) nLVO-IVT, 2) LVO-IVT, 3) LVO-MT. The result is provided as a distribution of disability (with six levels) following reperfusion treatment at any point between these two time stages: 1) receiving reperfusion treatment as soon as their stroke began (this will be referred to as time zero, and we will use the terminology “<em>t = 0</em>”), and 2) receiving reperfusion treatment at the duration after stroke onset where the treatment has no effect (this will be referred to as time no effect, and we will use the terminology “<em>t = No Effect</em>”).</p>
<p>The method is built using data from reperfusion treatment clinical trials (Lees et al. 2010, Emberson et al. 2014, Goyal et al. 2016, Fransen et al. 2016, and Hui et al. 2020) and 3 years worth of stroke admission data for England and Wales (Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme, SSNAP) to define the distribution of disability for each of the three patient-treatment cohorts at the two time stages (<em>t = 0</em> &amp; <em>t = No Effect</em>), and we use interpolation to determine the disability distribution at any point inbetween.</p>
<p>Detailed methodology and code are found in the notebooks on <a class="reference internal" href="mRS_datasets_full.html"><span class="doc std std-doc">derivation of mRS distributions at time of stroke onset and time when effect has decayed away</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="mRS_outcomes_maths.html"><span class="doc std std-doc">decay of effect over time</span></a>.</p>

<h2>Modified Rankin Scale<a class="headerlink" href="#modified-rankin-scale" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Disability levels may be measured in various ways. In this project we are using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). It is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke.</p>
<p>The scale runs from 0-6, running from perfect health without symptoms to death:</p>

<h2>Method and Results<a class="headerlink" href="#method-and-results" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>This model contains mRS outcome distributions for three patient-treatment cohorts: 1) nLVO-IVT, 2) LVO-IVT, 3) LVO-MT. For each patient-treatment cohort, we estimate two mRS distributions: one mRS distribution if treatment is given at <em>t = 0</em> (time of stroke onset), and one mRS distribution if treatment is given at <em>t = No Effect</em> (time of no effect). In order to estimate these two mRS distributions, we use data from reperfusion treatment clinical trials and from England and Wales stroke admission data. To select the relevant patients for each cohort we will use the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) on arrival as a surrogate to classify patients as nLVO (NIHSS 0-10) or LVO (NIHSS 11+).</p>
<p>The t=0 mRS distributions are based on the assumption that if reperfusion treatment is given immediately to a patient at stroke onset, there are only two possible outcomes for the patient. They are either 1) returned to their pre-stroke disability level (this data is obtained from the SSNAP dataset, or 2) the treatment has had no effect to combat the disability caused by a stroke (this data is obtained from the untreated control group in clinical trials and adjusted to include the risk of excess deaths caused by taking the treatment). Using published data we obtain the relevant weighting to use to combine these two distributions to represent the t=0 mRS distribution.</p>
<p>The <em>t = No Effect</em> mRS distributions are based on mRS distribution data when patients did not receive any treatment (this represents what will happen if the patient takes the treatment at t=NE). This data is obtained from the untreated control group in clinical trials and adjusted to include the risk of excess deaths caused by taking the treatment.</p>
<p>The two obtained mRS distribution estimates (one for <em>t = 0</em>, and one for <em>t = No Effect</em>) are shown in two different plot formats: a block plot (with <em>t = 0</em> at the top and <em>t = No Effect</em> at the bottom) and a line plot (with <em>t = 0</em> on the left, <em>t = No Effect</em> on the right, and the space between these points show the mRS distribution for any duration between these times). Below we will describe how we derived the two mRS distributions, and how they are represented in each of the charts, for each patient-treatment cohort in turn.</p>

<p>This section describes the methodology used to obtain the two mRS distribution estimates (<em>t = 0</em> and <em>t = No Effect</em>) for the patients with an nLVO that are treated with IVT.</p>
<section id="mrs-distribution-at-t-0-for-nlvo-ivt">
<h3>mRS distribution at <em>t = 0</em> (for nLVO-IVT)<a class="headerlink" href="#mrs-distribution-at-t-0-for-nlvo-ivt" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>We assume patients treated at t=0 are either fully recovered, or the treatment had no effect. We need a mRS distribution for each of these, and then take a weighted combination (61% fully recovered &amp; 39% no effect), where the weights are informed by Emberson et al. 2014.</p>
<p>The <strong>mRS distribution for fully recovered nLVO patients with IVT</strong> at t=0 is taken as the pre-stroke mRS distribution (this will represent a patient receiving a 100% effective treatment). This distribution comes from the SSNAP dataset, extracting the patients that have an ischaemic stroke and using NIHSS 0-10 as a surrogate for nLVO. This mRS distribution is then corrected for the excess deaths due to treatment with IVT for nLVO patients (1.10%, see appendix).</p>
<p>The <strong>mRS distribution for nLVO patients for which IVT had no effect</strong> at <em>t = 0</em> is assumed to be the same as patients that were not treated, but adjusted to include the risk of excess death caused by taking the treatment. Unfortunately there does not exist a large clinical trial for just nLVO patients from which we can take the results for the untreated control group. Instead we use the untreated control group of combined nLVO/LVO data from Lees et al. 2010, and from that we remove the contribution of the LVO patients by using the results from the untreated control group of LVO-only data from Goyal et al. 2016. Weightings for these two untreated control groups (149% Lees and -49% Goyal) are chosen such that once the contribution from the LVO patients to the combined nLVO/LVO distribution have been removed, the remaining mRS distribution matches the P(mRS &lt;= 1) of 0.46 (from the control group in Emberson with NIHSS of 0-10). This distribution is then corrected for the excess deaths due to treatment with IVT.</p>
<p>The <strong>weights</strong> used to combine these two mRS distribution (61% fully recovered &amp; 39% no effect) were informed by data from Emberson et al. 2014, and found in order to match the P(mRS &lt;= 1, t=0) of 0.63. It is seen from Emberson that 46% of patients with NIHSS 0-10 had mRS 0-1 in the untreated group (see figure 2 Emberson et al. 2014: (189 + 538)/(321 + 1252)). This translate into a 0.85 odds of a good outcome, which, when multipied with the odds ratio for mRS 0-1 at t=0 (which is 2.0, obtained from extrapolating back to t=0 in figure 1 “Effect of timing of alteplase treatment on good stroke outcome, mRS 0–1”), gives 1.70, before converting to a probability of 63%.</p>

We obtained this mRS distribution by taking the control population from Goyal et al. 2016. This distribution is then corrected for the excess deaths due to treatment with MT (3.6%, see appendix).</p>

<p>Here we use a line plot to show the expected mRS distribution if MT is given at any time between <em>t = 0</em> (left of plot) and t=NE (right of plot). It is assumed that the log odds decay uniformly over time between <em>t = 0</em> and <em>t = No Effect</em> (as modelled by Fransen et al. for MT). The time to no-effect treatment is taken as 8 hours for MT (Fransen et al). Note: the time to no effect from Fransen et al. did not incldue those patients who may be selected for late treatment based on advanced imaging. In this method we do not include late-presenting patients in our outcome modelling.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In Goyal’s metanalysis of thrombectomy, 85.1% of patients in the trial had also received thrombolysis. The trial results therefore mostly reflect IVT/MT vs MT alone. If patients first attend an IVT-only centre, then it is possible that if they respond well to thrombolysis they will not proceed to MT (they are, arguably, more likely to proceed to MT when IVT and MT are more tightly coupled in time). The overall benefit in LVO patients is likely to a conditional sum of IVT and MT benefit - that is patients may first benefit from IVT, and those patients who dot respond well to IVT may benefit from additional MT. Currently in the UK 52% of patients are admitted directly to an MT-capable centre (Phil White, private communication).</p></li>

<p>Excess deaths due to IVT are assumed to occur independently of time. Differing risks of death are applied according to whether the patient is assumed nLVO (NIHSS 0-10 as a surrogate for nLVO) or LVO (NIHSS 11+, as a surrogate for LVO). Note: Rounding errors exist in the “Excess” column.</p>

<p>The control group in Goyal et al. do not receive MT, but do receive other interventions such as IVT (used in 83% of patients). No additional IVT-related deaths need to be considered when modelling use of MT as the control group (used to estimate the effect of MT at a time MT is no longer effective) already includes IVT-related excess deaths.</p>
