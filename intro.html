<h1>Predicting granular disability outcomes after treatment of stroke with thrombolysis (IVT) or thrombectomy (MT)<a class="headerlink" href="#predicting-granular-disability-outcomes-after-treatment-of-stroke-with-thrombolysis-ivt-or-thrombectomy-mt" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h1>
<p>This notebook describes the basic methodology for estimating disability outcomes for stroke patients, depending on time to treatment with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) or mechanical thrombectomy (MT).</p>
<p>The methodology described here is for patients with an ischaemic stroke (a stroke that is caused by a clot). These patients can be further defined by the location of the clot: those with a large vessel occlusion (LVO); and those not with a large vessel occlusion (nLVO). Patients with an nLVO can be treated with thrombolysis (IVT), a clot-busting medication. Patients with an LVO can be treated with IVT and/or thrombectomy (MT), which physically removes the clot. The benefit received by the patient from either treatment (IVT and/or MT) are time dependent, such that the sooner they are administered, the better the outcome, with each treatment having no effect after a specified duration (6.3 hours for IVT, and 8 hours for MT). In other words, the sooner a patient recieves reperfusion treatment the fewer stroke related disabilities they could end up with.</p>
<p>Until now, modelling the outcome from stroke reperfusion treatment was a dichotomous affair, with a patient classified as either being disability free, or with stroke related disabilities. The method described here aims to provide a more granular disability outcome, describing the resulting disability as one of six levels (ranging from disability free, to death).</p>
<p>This method calculates disability outcome estimates for three patient-treatment cohorts: 1) nLVO-IVT (patients with an nLVO that are treated with IVT), 2) LVO-IVT (patients with an LVO that are treated with IVT), 3) LVO-MT (patients with an LVO that are treated with MT). The result is provided as a distribution of disability (with six levels) following reperfusion treatment at any point between these two time stages: 1) receiving reperfusion treatment as soon as their stroke began (this will be referred to as time of stroke onset, and we will use the terminology “<em>t = 0</em>”), and 2) receiving reperfusion treatment at the duration after stroke onset where the treatment has no effect (this will be referred to as time of no effect, and we will use the terminology “<em>t = No Effect</em>”).</p>
<p>The method is built using data from reperfusion treatment clinical trials (Lees et al. 2010, Emberson et al. 2014, Goyal et al. 2016, Fransen et al. 2016, and Hui et al. 2020) and 3 years worth of stroke admission data for England and Wales (Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme, SSNAP) to define the distribution of disability for each of the three patient-treatment cohorts at the two time stages (<em>t = 0</em> &amp; <em>t = No Effect</em>), and we use interpolation to determine the disability distribution at any point inbetween.</p>
<p>Detailed methodology and code are found in the notebooks on <a class="reference internal" href="mRS_datasets_full.html"><span class="doc std std-doc">derivation of mRS distributions</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="mRS_outcomes_maths.html"><span class="doc std std-doc">decay of effect over time</span></a>.</p>

<h2>Modified Rankin Scale<a class="headerlink" href="#modified-rankin-scale" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Disability levels may be measured in various ways. In this project we are using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). It is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke.</p>
<p>The scale runs from 0-6, running from perfect health without symptoms to death:</p>

<h2>Method and Results<a class="headerlink" href="#method-and-results" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>This model contains mRS outcome distributions for three patient-treatment cohorts: 1) nLVO-IVT, 2) LVO-IVT, 3) LVO-MT. For each patient-treatment cohort, we estimate two mRS distributions: one mRS distribution if treatment is given at <em>t = 0</em> (time of stroke onset), and one mRS distribution if treatment is given at <em>t = No Effect</em> (time of no effect). In order to estimate these two mRS distributions, we use data from reperfusion treatment clinical trials and stroke admission data from England and Wales. To select the relevant patients for each cohort we will use the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) on arrival as a surrogate to classify patients as nLVO (NIHSS 0-10) or LVO (NIHSS 11+).</p>
<p>All mRS distributions created are based on the assumption that, following treatment, the mRS distribution will lie between two extremes: 1) reperfusion perfectly restores function, and the resulting mRS distribution is the same as the pre-stroke mRS distribution (this data is obtained from the SSNAP dataset), and 2) reperfusion treatment fails to restore any function and the resulting mRS distribution is the same as a control untreated population, though with added excess deaths that may be caused by the treatment. To create required mRS distributions we find a weighting between these two extremes that give us a distribution that matches published reference points.</p>
<p>The <em>t = 0</em> mRS distributions are calculated to give the expected mRS distributions if treatment was given immediately after stroke onset, and also include the risk of excess deaths caused by taking the treatment. Further details specific to stroke type and treatment type are given below.</p>
<p>The <em>t = No Effect</em> mRS distributions are based on mRS distribution data when patients did not receive any treatment (this represents what will happen if the patient takes the treatment at <em>t = No Effect</em>). This data is obtained from the untreated control group in clinical trials and further adjusted to include the risk of excess deaths caused by taking the treatment. Further details specific to stroke type and treatment type are given below.</p>
<p>The two obtained mRS distribution estimates (one for <em>t = 0</em>, and one for <em>t = No Effect</em>) are shown in two different plot formats: a block plot (with <em>t = 0</em> at the top and <em>t = No Effect</em> at the bottom) and a line plot (with <em>t = 0</em> on the left, <em>t = No Effect</em> on the right, and the space between these points show the mRS distribution for any point between these times). Below we will describe how we derived the two mRS distributions, and how they are represented in each of the charts, for each patient-treatment cohort in turn.</p>

<h2>Patient-treatment cohort 1: nLVO-IVT<a class="headerlink" href="#patient-treatment-cohort-1-nlvo-ivt" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>This section describes the methodology used to obtain the two mRS distribution estimates (<em>t = 0</em> and <em>t = No Effect</em>) for the patients with an nLVO that are treated with IVT.</p>

<h3>mRS distribution at <em>t = 0</em> (for nLVO-IVT)<a class="headerlink" href="#mrs-distribution-at-t-0-for-nlvo-ivt" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>We assume that the mRS distribution for patients treated at <em>t = 0</em> will be a weighted average of a full recovery distribution, and a no-benefit distribution, including a correction for risk of treatment-related death (we assume that risk is independent of the time treatment is given). We need a mRS distribution for each of these, and then take a weighted combination (61% fully recovered &amp; 39% no effect), where the weights are informed by Emberson et al. 2014.</p>
<p>The <strong>mRS distribution for fully recovered nLVO patients with IVT</strong> at <em>t = 0</em> is taken as the pre-stroke mRS distribution (this will represent a patient receiving a 100% effective treatment). This distribution comes from the SSNAP dataset, extracting the patients that have an ischaemic stroke and using NIHSS 0-10 as a surrogate for nLVO. This mRS distribution is then corrected for the excess deaths due to treatment with IVT for nLVO patients (1.10%, see appendix).</p>
<p>The <strong>mRS distribution for nLVO patients for which IVT had no effect</strong> is assumed to be the same as patients that were not treated, but adjusted to include the risk of excess death caused by taking the treatment. Unfortunately there does not exist a large clinical trial for just nLVO patients from which we can take the results for the untreated control group. Instead we use the untreated control group of combined nLVO/LVO data from Lees et al. 2010, and from that we remove the contribution of the LVO patients by using the results from the untreated control group of LVO-only data from Goyal et al. 2016. Each mRS distribution (Lees, and Goyal) are adjusted to account for the excess deaths due to IVT treatment, this is 2.29% for the combined nLVO/LVO patients and 3.41% for LVO patients (see appendix). Weightings for these two mRS distributions (154% Lees and -54% Goyal) are chosen such that once the contribution from the LVO patients have been removed from the combined nLVO/LVO distribution, the remaining mRS distribution matches the P(mRS &lt;= 1, <em>t = No Effect</em>) of 0.46 (from the control group in Emberson with NIHSS of 0-10).</p>
<p>The <strong>weights</strong> used to combine these two mRS distribution (61% fully recovered &amp; 39% no effect) were informed by data from Emberson et al. 2014, and found in order to match the P(mRS &lt;= 1, <em>t = 0</em>) of 0.63. It is seen from Emberson that 46% of patients with NIHSS 0-10 had mRS 0-1 in the untreated group (see figure 2 Emberson et al. 2014: (189 + 538)/(321 + 1252)). This translates into a 0.85 odds of a good outcome, which, when multipied by the odds ratio for mRS 0-1 at <em>t = 0</em> (which is 2.0, obtained from extrapolating back to <em>t = 0</em> in figure 1 “Effect of timing of alteplase treatment on good stroke outcome, mRS 0–1”), gives 1.70, before converting to a probability of 63%.</p>

<p>The <strong>mRS distribution for LVO patients for which MT had no effect</strong> is assumed to be the same as patients that were not treated, but adjusted to include the risk of excess death caused by taking the treatment. We obtained this mRS distribution by taking the untreated control population from Goyal et al. 2016. This distribution is then corrected for the deaths due to treatment with MT (3.6%, see appendix).</p>
<p>The <strong>weights</strong> used to combine these two mRS distributions (75% fully recovered &amp; 25% no effect) are taken from Hui et al. 2020, who reported 75% successful recanalisation with thrombectomy.</p>
<p>*Extrapolating results of good outcome, when recanalisation has been achieved with MT, from Fransen et al. 2016 back to <em>t = 0</em>, assuming 75% recanalisation, gives the same proportion of patients with mRS &lt;= 2 as the pre-stroke mRS in the SSNAP data (therefore this extrapolation would suggest full recovery of all health with MT theoretically carried out at <em>t = 0</em>).</p>

<p>Here we use a line plot to show the expected mRS distribution if MT is given at any time between <em>t = 0</em> (left) and <em>t = No Effect</em> (right). It is assumed that the log odds decay uniformly over time between <em>t = 0</em> and <em>t = No Effect</em> (as modelled by Fransen et al. for MT). The time to no-effect treatment is taken as 8 hours for MT (Fransen et al). Note: the time to no effect from Fransen et al. did not include those patients who may be selected for late treatment based on advanced imaging. In this method we do not include late-presenting patients in our outcome modelling.</p>

<p>In our calculations above, we include treatment-related deaths in our predicted mRS distribution. When estimating the clinical benefit of reperfusion treatment we calculate mRS distributions for untreated patients, without the addition of excess deaths. The method is similar to those described above, but without addition of excess deaths.

<li><p>In Goyal’s metanalysis of MT, 85.1% of patients in the trial had also received IVT. The trial results therefore mostly reflect IVT/MT vs MT alone. If patients first attend an IVT-only centre, then it is possible that if they respond well to IVT they will not proceed to MT (they are, arguably, more likely to proceed to MT when IVT and MT are more tightly coupled in time). The overall benefit in LVO patients is likely to a conditional sum of IVT and MT benefit - that is patients may first benefit from IVT, and those patients who do not respond well to IVT may benefit from additional MT. Currently in the UK 52% of patients are admitted directly to an MT-capable centre (Phil White, private communication).</p></li>

<p>Excess deaths due to IVT are assumed to occur independently of time. Differing risks of death are applied according to whether the patient is assumed nLVO (NIHSS 0-10 as a surrogate for nLVO) or LVO (NIHSS 11+, as a surrogate for LVO). Note: Rounding errors exist in the “Excess” column.</p>
<p>We use Embersons 2.29% excess deaths from IVT on all patients (nLVO and LVO) with the combined nLVO/LVO population from Lees et al. 2010. From the available trial data, we assume that the split between nLVO/LVO is as near the same in both Lees and Emberson:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Lees has 3670 patients, they provide a granular level of mRS distribution for their population (combined nLVO/LVO) but they do not provide the proportions of the split.</p></li>
<li><p>Emberson has 6756 patients (they have the 3035 patients from IST-3 in addition to those in Lees, with 51 unaccounted for), they provide the excess deaths by stroke severity. To obtain their value of 2.29% excess deaths from IVT for all patients, this requires a weighting of 48.27% nLVO and 51.73% LVO.</p></li>
<li><p>IST-3 has 3035 patients and provide proportion of patients by stroke severity: 48.24% nLVO and 51.76% LVO. This is as near as the same that we have calculated in Emberson.</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming that Lees contains the other patients in Emberson (those not from IST-3), then it is a fair assumption that Lees has the same split (nLVO/LVO) of patients as Emberson, and so can use 2.29% excess deaths from IVT for Lees combined nLVO/LVO population.</p></li>

<p>The control group in Goyal et al. do not receive MT, but do receive other interventions such as IVT (used in 83% of patients). No additional IVT-related deaths need to be considered when modelling use of MT as the control group (used to estimate the effect of MT at a time MT is no longer effective) already includes IVT-related excess deaths.</p>
