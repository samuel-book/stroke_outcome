# Proportion of ischaemic patients with LVO

The proportion of ischaemic patients with LVO may be estimated in various ways. Estimates are likely to be swayed by the population being studied (e.g. treatment trial results may under-estimate nLVO as very low severity patients may not be selected for the trial). Below are various estimates of the relative occurrence of LVO and nLVO.

## Analysis of SAMueL data

Data from SAMueL using NIHSS 11+ as a surrogate for LVO:

| Admission type                       | All arrivals | Arrival within 6 hrs known onset | Arrival within 4 hrs known onset |
|--------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Proportion all admissions            | 100          | 42.9                             | 37.1                             |
| Proportion haemorrhagic              | 11.5         | 13.6                             | 14.1                             |
| Proportion ischaemic                 | 88.5         | 86.4                             | 85.9                             |
| Proportion ischaemic with NIHSS 0-10 | 74.9         | 67.4                             | 65.7                             |
| Proportion ischaemic with NIHSS 11+  | 25.1         | 32.6                             | 34.3                             |

## RACECAT pre-hospital diagnosis of LVO

A breakdown on stroke type from the design of the RACE test for pre-hopsital diagnosis of LVO (de la Ossa Herrero et al., 2013). Note - there appears to be some discrepancies between reporting of the results between the text and the detailed breakdown by RACE score in figure 2 of the paper.

* Trial recruited from patients who presented at the emergency department within 6 hours from symptoms onset.

* In the text: Of 357 patients in the analysis, the stroke subtype was ischemic stroke in 240 (67.2%), hemorrhagic stroke in 52 (14.6%), transient ischemic attack in 20 (5.6%), and stroke mimic in 45 (12.6%). LVO was detected in 76 patients (31.7% of ischaemic strokes).

* In figure 2: Of 357 patients in the analysis, the stroke subtype was ischemic stroke in 260 (72.8), hemorrhagic stroke in 52 (14.6%), and stroke mimic in 45 (12.6%). LVO was detected in 99 patients (38.1% of ischaemic strokes). 

* It appears that TIAs may be counted in with ischaemic strokes in this analysis.

## Estimating the number of UK stroke patients eligible for endovascular thrombectomy (review/analysis)

McMeekin et al. (2017) review the evdidence for estimating the number of UK stroke patients eligible for endovascular thrombectomy. They estimate:

* 40% of ischaemic stroke patients have LVO; 80% of which have NIHSS >=6 and may be suitable for thrombectomy. This is equivalent to 32% of admitted patients having LVO suitable for thrombectomy.

## Thrombolysis meta-analysis (Emberson et al.) 

In Emberson's meta-analysis of thrombolysis trials, 52.6% of all participants had a NIHSS of 11+ (a surrogate for LVO).
