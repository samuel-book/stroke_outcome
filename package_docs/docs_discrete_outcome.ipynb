    "# Documentation: Discrete outcome model\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook describes how the discrete outcome model works. \n",
    "\n",
    "> If you're looking for an example of the code to run the model, look at [the demo notebook](https://github.com/stroke-modelling/stroke-outcome/blob/main/demo/demo_discrete_outcomes.ipynb) instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The discrete outcome model calculates modified Rankin Scale (mRS) distributions for ischaemic stroke patients. \n",
    "The outcomes depend on time to treatment with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) or mechanical thrombectomy (MT). \n",
    "The results are broken down separately for large vessel occulusions (LVO) and non large vessel occlusions (nLVO).\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is called \"discrete\" because each patient is assigned one integer mRS score at each point of the calculation. For example, a patient can have an mRS score of 1 or of 2, but never of 1.2. The score must be one of seven discrete values - 0 to 6 inclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model also calculates utility-weighted mRS scores.\n",
    "                             \n",
    "### Summary of the method:\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps will be shown in more detail in the rest of this document.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the base mRS distributions\n",
    "2. Take the patient data, which must include:\n",
    "    + Stroke type\n",
    "    + Whether treated with IVT, and if so the time from onset to IVT\n",
    "    + Whether treated with MT, and if so the time from onset to MT\n",
    "    + Either the pre-stroke mRS score, or an fixed probability score\n",
    "3. Group the patients by stroke type and treatment. The subgroups are:\n",
    "    + nLVO and IVT\n",
    "    + LVO and IVT\n",
    "    + LVO and MT\n",
    "3. Calculate the patient mRS distributions for each subgroup.\n",
    "    + The outcomes vary with time. Patients who receive treatment have their post-stroke mRS distribution calculated for their individual treatment times.\n",
    "    + Patients who receive treatment after the time of no effect use the mRS distribution at the time of no effect.\n",
    "    + Patients who receive no treatment use the mRS distribution for no treatment.\n",
    "4. Read each patient's post-stroke mRS score from the mRS distributions by using their fixed probability, and convert to utility.\n",
    "5. Also read each patient's mRS score and utility had they not been treated and find the shift in mRS and utility due to treatment.\n",
    "4. Combine the subgroups to match the input patient data\n",
    "    + Each patient in the input data is given only one set of post-stroke data even if they appear in multiple subgroups."

    "combined full cohort outcomes, only one of the sets of outcomes can be\n",
    "used. The chosen set is the one with the better improvement in outcomes.\n",
    "The separate LVO+IVT and LVO+MT results dictionaries are then *not* updated to remove\n",
    "the rejected set of outcomes, so any mean shifts in values across the\n",
    "LVO+IVT group (for example) could include data that was not actually used\n",
    "in the combined full cohort outcomes.\n",

    "This is done to make all of the input data numeric and so easier to export.\n",
    "\n",
    "__\"Other\" stroke types:__ Currently \"other\" stroke types are not used in the calculations. This is due to the unavailability of mRS probability distributions for various \"other\" stroke types."

    "\n",
    "We know that the size of the effect of treatment depends on how soon the treatment was administered after the stroke onset. This means that the post-stroke mRS distribution we associate with a patient depends on their treatment time. \n",

    "1) Take the base probability mRS distributions for treatment at time zero and for treatment at the time of no effect.\n",
    "2) Convert the probabilities to odds and then to log(odds).\n",
    "3) Assume that log(odds) decreases linearly with time from the time-zero values to the time-of-no-effect values. Connect each time-zero value to its matching time-of-no-effect value with a straight line.\n",

    "## Fixed probability\n",
    "\n",
    "We use an fixed probability to compare a patient's expected mRS score across multiple mRS distributions. Rather than picking the score randomly from anywhere in the distribution, we always pick the score from the same cumulative probability value. This method is independent of where exactly the mRS score boundaries are in the distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of this method is that when it is used to select mRS scores for large numbers of patients, the distribution of picked mRS scores will recreate the mRS distribution that we started with. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main disadvantage is that the results are limited for an individual patient. A patient who starts with an mRS score of 0 can usually expect to receive a low post-stroke mRS score such as 0 to 2, and never to receive a high score such as 5 or 6. \n",
    "\n",
    "Individually, the results are quite restricted. Statistically, across many thousands of patients, the results are sampled fairly and any oddities average themselves out.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The following image shows two mRS probability distributions, one for the nLVO treatment with IVT at time zero and one for nLVO patients receiving no treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the mRS scores for a single patient, we mark the fixed fixed probability on the probability scale. The marker points at one mRS bin in each distribution. The mRS score of that bin is given to the patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Two mRS distributions are shown with a marker at the same cumulative probability for both distributions.](images/x_factor_example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "By using this method with a distribution after treatment and a distribution without treatment, we can find the effect of treatment on the mRS and utility of this patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following image shows the mRS probability distributions varying across time, and some information for two patients. Both patients have a pre-stroke mRS score of 1 and are treated at the same time, 3 hours after their stroke began. However, they have different fixed probabilities. Patient \"X\" has a score of 0.6 and Patient \"Y\" has a score of 0.72. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Even though the pre-stroke mRS scores are the same, the post-stroke mRS scores are different. The post-stroke mRS scores are 2 for Patient \"X\" and 3 for Patient \"Y\". This is due only to the different fixed probabilities selected.\n",
