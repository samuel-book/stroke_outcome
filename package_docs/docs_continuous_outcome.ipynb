    "# Documentation: Continuous outcome model\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook describes how the continuous outcome model works. \n",
    "\n",
    "> If you're looking for an example of the code to run the model, look at [the demo notebook](https://github.com/stroke-modelling/stroke-outcome/blob/main/demo/demo_continuous_outcomes.ipynb) instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The continuous outcome model calculates modified Rankin Scale (mRS) distributions for ischaemic stroke patients. \n",
    "The outcomes depend on time to treatment with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) or mechanical thrombectomy (MT). \n",
    "The results are broken down separately for large vessel occulusions (LVO) and non large vessel occlusions (nLVO).\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is called \"continuous\" because it does not assign each patient a single mRS score from a small set of discrete values, but instead takes the mRS score from a continuous scale. \n",
    "For example, a patient could receive an mRS score of 2.33.\n",
    "In this continuous system, a patient's mRS score is taken as the mean across a probability distribution of mRS scores. \n",
    "This emulates the expected mean mRS score across a whole population of patients who are identical except for their starting mRS score, and the distribution of those starting mRS scores matches the reference population data that is used by the outcome model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model also calculates utility-weighted mRS scores.\n",
    "                             \n",
    "### Summary of the method:\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps will be shown in more detail in the rest of this document.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the base mRS distributions and calculate their mean mRS and utilities\n",
    "2. Take the patient data, which must include:\n",
    "    + Stroke type\n",
    "    + Whether treated with IVT, and if so the time from onset to IVT\n",
    "    + Whether treated with MT, and if so the time from onset to MT\n",
    "3. Group the patients by stroke type and treatment. The subgroups are:\n",
    "    + nLVO and IVT\n",
    "    + LVO and IVT\n",
    "    + LVO and MT\n",
    "3. Calculate the patient outcomes for each subgroup.\n",
    "    + The outcomes vary with time. Patients who receive treatment have their post-stroke mRS distribution calculated for their individual treatment times.\n",
    "    + Patients who receive treatment after the time of no effect use the mRS distribution at the time of no effect.\n",
    "    + Patients who receive no treatment use the mRS distribution for no treatment.\n",
    "4. Combine the subgroups to match the input patient data\n",
    "    + Each patient in the input data is given only one set of post-stroke data even if they appear in multiple subgroups."
